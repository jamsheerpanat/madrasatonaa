# Madrasatonaa Rebuild Rules

1. Everything is driven by the School Day Timeline.
2. There are no modules — only timeline events.
3. Every timeline event is validated by a strict JSON schema.
4. Web and Mobile must use the same API projections.
5. Teachers own the day. Admin supports silently.
6. If a feature breaks these rules, it does not ship.
